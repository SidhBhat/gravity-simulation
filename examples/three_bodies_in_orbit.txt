Three bodies are in a stable configuration. This is only possible when
the bodies have large differance in masses. The secodary systems Centre
of mass in a prefectly circular orbit about the central barycentre. Even
the secondary system is in a prefectly circular orbit about the Centre of 
mass.

### Define environment ###
# The gravitaional constant
global G = 4.5;

# define the initial parameters of the bodies
# here you can define as many bodies as you like in similar fasion
global bodies;              # don't touch this line

bodies(1).m = 10;           # mass
bodies(1).x = [0,43.761];   # position
bodies(1).v = [-14.359,0];  # velocity

bodies(2).m = 100;          # mass

### Simulation Parameters
